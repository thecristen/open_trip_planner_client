  Corresponds to `RoutingErrorCode` from OTP `plan` query.
  Possible values as of OTPv2.4.0:

  * `NO_TRANSIT_CONNECTION`: No transit connection was found between the origin
  and destination within the operating day or the next day, not even sub-optimal
  ones.

  * `NO_TRANSIT_CONNECTION_IN_SEARCH_WINDOW`: A transit connection was found,
  but it was outside the search window. See the metadata for a token for
  retrieving the result outside the search window.

  * `OUTSIDE_SERVICE_PERIOD`: The date specified is outside the range of data
  currently loaded into the system as it is too far into the future or the past.
  The specific date range of the system is configurable by an administrator and
  also depends on the input data provided.

  * `OUTSIDE_BOUNDS`: The coordinates are outside the geographic bounds of the
  transit and street data currently loaded into the system and therefore cannot
  return any results.

  * `LOCATION_NOT_FOUND`: The specified location is not close to any streets or
  transit stops currently loaded into the system, even though it is generally
  within its bounds. This can happen when there is only transit but no street
  data coverage at the location in question.

  * `NO_STOPS_IN_RANGE`: No stops are reachable from the start or end locations
  specified. You can try searching using a different access or egress mode, for
  example cycling instead of walking, increase the walking/cycling/driving speed
  or have an administrator change the system's configuration so that stops
  further away are considered.

  * `WALKING_BETTER_THAN_TRANSIT`: Transit connections were requested and found
  but because it is easier to just walk all the way to the destination they were
  removed. If you want to still show the transit results, you need to make
  walking less desirable by increasing the walk reluctance.

  Possible planner error messages, taken from `Message.properties` in the OTP
  source. Possible values as of OTPv2.4.0:

  * `SYSTEM_ERROR`: We're sorry. The trip planner is temporarily unavailable.
  Please try again later.

  * `GRAPH_UNAVAILABLE`: We're sorry. The trip planner is temporarily
  unavailable. Please try again later.

  * `OUTSIDE_BOUNDS`: Trip is not possible. You might be trying to plan a trip
  outside the map data boundary.

  * `PROCESSING_TIMEOUT`: The trip planner is taking too long to process your
  request.

  * `BOGUS_PARAMETER`: The request has errors that the server is not willing or
    able to process.

  * `LOCATION_NOT_ACCESSIBLE`: The location was found, but no stops could be
  found within the search radius.

  * `PATH_NOT_FOUND`: No trip found. There may be no transit service within the
  maximum specified distance or at the specified time, or your start or end
  point might not be safely accessible.

  * `NO_TRANSIT_TIMES`: No transit times available. The date may be past or too
  far in the future or there may not be transit service for your trip at the
  time you chose.

  * `GEOCODE_FROM_NOT_FOUND`: Origin is unknown. Can you be a bit more
    descriptive?

  * `GEOCODE_TO_NOT_FOUND`: Destination is unknown.  Can you be a bit more
    descriptive?

  * `GEOCODE_FROM_TO_NOT_FOUND`: Both origin and destination are unknown. Can
    you be a bit more descriptive?

  * `GEOCODE_INTERMEDIATE_NOT_FOUND` An intermediate destination is unknown. Can
  you be a bit more descriptive?.

  * `TOO_CLOSE`: Origin is within a trivial distance of the destination.

  * `UNDERSPECIFIED_TRIANGLE`: All of triangleSafetyFactor, triangleSlopeFactor,
  and triangleTimeFactor must be set if any are

  * `TRIANGLE_NOT_AFFINE`: The values of triangleSafetyFactor,
  triangleSlopeFactor, and triangleTimeFactor must sum to 1

  * `TRIANGLE_OPTIMIZE_TYPE_NOT_SET`: If triangleSafetyFactor,
  triangleSlopeFactor, and triangleTimeFactor are provided, OptimizeType must be

  * `TRIANGLE_VALUES_NOT_SET`: If OptimizeType is TRIANGLE,
