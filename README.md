Shared functionality for working with
[OpenTripPlanner](https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/v2.4.0/), curated to the
MBTA's needs.

Use with caution – this is in early stages and we expect things can change!
Feedback welcomed.

## Installation

Not on Hex (yet?). Github-hosted Elixir libraries such as this one can be added
to a project's dependencies in `mix.exs` in this way:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    %{:open_trip_planner_client,
      [
        github: "thecristen/open_trip_planner_client",
        ref: "v0.5.0"
      ]}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get`.

## Configuration

The library expects a URL to a running instance of OpenTripPlanner, and a
timezone name that's used to parse and format input `DateTime`s into the correct
strings for input into OpenTripPlanner. Valid timezone names are from the Olson
database; valid values can be found using
[`Timex.timezones/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/timex/Timex.html#timezones/0). Ideally
the timezone matches that configured in the OpenTripPlanner instance.

### OpenTripPlanner requirements

The OpenTripPlanner instance needs to be version 2, with the GraphQL API
enabled. 

If using the
[`transitModelTimeZone`](https://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/v2.4.0/BuildConfiguration/?h=timezone#transitModelTimeZone)
build parameter, it should be consistent with the timezone name indicated in
this configuration.

```elixir
config :open_trip_planner_client,
  otp_url: "http://localhost:8080",
  timezone: "America/New_York"
```

## Usage

Documentation is automatically generated with every
[release](https://github.com/thecristen/open_trip_planner_client/releases), and
the latest docs are published on [Github
Pages](http://github.thecristen.net/open_trip_planner_client/).

### Trip planning

At minimum, origin and destination must specify either a valid `:stop_id` or `:lat_lon`
value, and can optionally include a `:name`.

```elixir
origin = [stop_id: "place-north"]
destination = [name: "Park Plaza", lat_lon: {42.348777, -71.066481}]
%{:ok, itineraries} = OpenTripPlannerClient.plan(origin, destination, [])
```

The `t:OpenTripPlannerClient.Behaviour.plan_opt/0` type describes additional expected parameters, which include specifying the departure or arrival times, filtering for wheelchair accessibility, and generating one or more supported tags.

```elixir
plan(origin, destination, arriveBy: ~N[2024-04-15T09:00:00])
plan(origin, destination, wheelchair: false, departBy: ~N[2024-03-30T11:24:00])
```

The list of itineraries returned are directly from
OpenTripPlanner, and consumers are expected to handle further parsing. Refer to the [test fixture](/test/fixture/alewife_to_franklin_park_zoo.json) for expected fields.

### Trip planning with tagging

A special `:tags` feature will score the list of itineraries against a specified
criteria. This client provides several tag implementations, and it's also
possible to create custom tags, by implementing the
`OpenTripPlannerClient.ItineraryTag` behaviour.


```elixir
alias OpenTripPlannerClient.ItineraryTag

tags = [
  ItineraryTag.EarliestArrival,
  ItineraryTag.LeastWalking,
  ItineraryTag.ShortestTrip
]
{:ok, itineraries} = plan(origin, destination, tags: tags)
```

The returned itineraries include an extra field, `"tag"`, which will contain the relevant tag.

```elixir
[:shortest_trip, :least_walking, nil] = Enum.map(itineraries, &Map.get(&1, "tag"))
```
